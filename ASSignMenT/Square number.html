    <h3>A Long Quote-BY Christina Nuñez</h3>
    <p>I LOVE Valentines Day, but lately I’ve been feeling like I’m in the minority. I hear people say things like it’s a “hallmark holiday,” or “it’s designed to make people who aren’t in relationships feel bad about themselves.” I couldn’t disagree more!

The way I see it, Valentines Day is just an excuse to shower the people in our lives who matter to us with love. Call me a romantic, but I believe love is the most powerful force we’ve got. Regardless of where we’re from, we’ve all experienced it in some shape or form.

Case in point- Every now and again, members from our team will ask global citizens what they feel makes a global citizen. And you know what word repeatedly comes up? Love. Loving our neighbors, loving the planet, you name it. There is so much to say about love and its power to bring people together, but I feel I can’t do the word justice. Instead, here are ten inspiring quotes that I hope will warm your heart this Valentines Day :)
